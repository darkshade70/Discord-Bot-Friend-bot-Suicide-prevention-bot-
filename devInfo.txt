Developer Information
---------------------
Howdy, I hope your having a nice day so far :sunny:

If you've used this command, I'm assuming that you want to learn
a little more about me and the Kiona discord bot. I'd be happy to share

Kiona
------
Believe it or not, this bot was inspired by a real person. Shocker right?
Throughout my life I've been able to befriend and talk with many different
types of people, many of them becoming my close friends. Unfortunately, we
can't all go through life without experiencing some ups and downs. This discord
bot was inspired to help those who might be down on their luck. It's in no ways a
permanent solution for those suffering from depression or other mental illness but,
Kiona does try its best. Interactions may include chatting, fun commands/Jokes,
and spreading awareness by educating people on numerous mental health illnesses and
their impacts on people.

There nothing interesting to note about me, I'd much rather talk more about the
bot to be honest. I started this progress in my senior year of high school. I've
never worked with discord.py or any APIs so it was definitely a fun learning experience.
There were two main goals with this project, one to genuinely make some sort of application
that can help someone in need of a friend, and to experiment with machine learning and
natural language processing. I believe that machine learning is the future and with it,
dreams and fantasies came be made into reality. My "end goal" as you might call it, would
be work on a full body VR suit that is accessible and affordable for the general population, kinda
like the TeslaSuit. For further inquiries my contact will be listed below.
